                            Gym Partner is a health and fitness app that allows users to plan exercise routines, 
                            set fitness goals, and track their improvement over time. It involves the use of 
                            technologies such as Rails 6, React, React Native (soon), PostgreSQL, Heroku, and Netlify.

                            This project is currently composed of two separate applications: a React web-client
                            and a Rails back-end. The Rails app functions as a JSON API, and its purpose is to recieve
                            JSON-formatted data from the React client, process it in whatever way it needs, and return JSON data back to 
                            the React client. This decoupled architecture was used because I plan to integrate a React Native 
                            mobile app with this project in the future, and this setup serves to make that process a bit easier.

                            This application's database schema requires tables with <em>many-to-many</em> relationships, 
                            and uses <em>has-many-through</em> associations between Active Record models to represent these 
                            relationships. This project was a fun exploration of Rails's Active Record ORM framework, 
                            and provided a deeper look at the power and programming convenience Active Record can give 
                            back-end developers over bare-metal SQL.
