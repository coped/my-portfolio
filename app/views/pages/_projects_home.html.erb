                    Private Events is a web application similar to Eventbrite. Users can create, attend, and 
                    send invitations for events. The app was created using Rails 6, Bulma CSS, and PostgreSQL.

                    This application's database schema requires tables with <em>many-to-many</em> relationships, 
                    and uses <em>has-many-through</em> associations between Active Record models to represent these 
                    relationships. This project was a fun exploration of Rails's Active Record ORM framework, 
                    and provided a deeper look at the power and programming convenience Active Record can give 
                    back-end developers over bare-metal SQL.
